Overview
This web application predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases, specifically heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease, using machine learning models. The app offers visual insights into health metrics and trends, and it is designed for ease of use with an interactive interface built using Streamlit.

Features

Prediction Models: Provides accurate predictions for heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease.
User-Friendly Interface: An interactive, easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
Visual Insights: Offers key visualizations that showcase patterns and trends within the datasets.
Datasets

The application uses three datasets, each tailored to different diseases:

1.Heart Disease Dataset: Contains health metrics related to heart conditions.
2.Kidney Disease Dataset: Includes features associated with kidney function and the presence of kidney disease.
3.Liver Disease Dataset: Comprises health measurements related to liver function and liver diseases.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comprehensive EDA has been conducted on each dataset to:

Understand the distribution and relationships of features.
Identify missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Visualize key trends and correlations through charts and graphs.
Machine Learning Models

The application implements and evaluates several machine learning models to predict the diseases accurately:

1.Logistic Regression
2.Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3.Random Forests (optional)
4.Decision Tree Classifier
5.Gradient Boosting Classifier
6.KNN 

Installation: Steps for setting up the project locally, including installing required dependencies, are provided.

Usage: Instructions on how to run the application, input data, and interpret predictions.
